        <p>To extend a class: class Child extends Parent:
        That means Child.prototype.__proto__ will be Parent.prototype, so methods are inherited.</p>
        
        <p>When overriding a constructor:
        We must call parent constructor as super() in Child constructor before using this.</p>
        
        <p>When overriding another method:
        We can use super.method() in a Child method to call Parent method.</p>
        
        <p>Internals:
        Methods remember their class/object in the internal [[HomeObject]] property. That’s how super resolves parent methods.
        So it’s not safe to copy a method with super from one object to another.</p>
        
        <p>Also:
        Arrow functions don’t have their own this or super, so they transparently fit into the surrounding context.</p>
